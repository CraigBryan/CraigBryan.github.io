              <p>
                My name is Craig Bryan and I'm a student at the University of Ottawa. I'm studying Software Engineering, I'm in my fourth year, and I love it.
              </p>
              <h1>December 2015</h1>
              <p>
                That's when I'll graduate. If all goes according to plan.

              <p>
                I'm currently searching the start of my professional career. I am interested in a 4-month position from May to September 2015, and for a full-time permanent position starting in January 2016.

              <h3>Dalhousie University</h3>
              <p>
                From 2007 to 2011, I studied I graduated from Dalhousie University with a BSc in Chemistry. I covered all of the classic sciences (biology, chemistry, physics) to some extent, but nearing the end of my degree I specialized in materials science. This specialization was mostly the result of working in a materials science laboratory for my honour's project under the supervision Dr. Mary Anne White. 
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition to the technical chemistry knowledge, I learned a lot of 'soft-skills'. In particular, I found that lab work, if it is to be done correctly and safely, requires a great deal of attention to detail. I also honed my communication skills, particular written, by writing research papers and lab reports on a regular basis.
              </p>

              <p>
                During my career at Dalhousie University, I was forunate to have the opportunity to participate in two published research papers. The first, <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.86.054303">Thermal conductivity of (Er<sub>1-x</sub>Y<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> pyrochlore oxide solid solutions</a>, I am the primary author of, and is the result of my year of working in Dr. White's lab. The second, <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed4001409">Bismuth Crystals: Preparation and Measurement of Thermal and Electrical Properties</a>, was the result of a fun, crystal-growth experiment that I did in my first year at Dalhousie University.
              </p>

              <h3>University of Ottawa</h3>
              <p>
                After I graduated with my degree in chemistry, I focused on finding a job related to my field. After months of searching, I ended up as an IT technician for a television and consumer electronics store; a job that I was grateful for, but not related to chemistry. At the same time, my interest in software development and programming had been growing. I decided I should be focusing on the thing I enjoyed, and I applied to software engineering and computer science at a variety of Universities.
              </p>

              <p>
                I started at the University of Ottawa in September 2012, as a second year student. During the two years that I've spent here, I've learned a great deal of technical skills &mdash; languages, design patterns, frameworks, and tools &mdash; but I'm finding I learn the most in working with fellow students. Collaborations challenge my communication skills, my leadership abilities, and my empathy.

              <h3>Developer for UmpleOnline</h3>
              <p>
                This past summer (May to August, 2014), I worked as a developer on an open source project called <a href="http://cruise.eecs.uottawa.ca/umple/">Umple</a>. Umple is tool that enables &quot;Model-Oriented Programming&quot;. It is a project based primarily at the University of Ottawa and managed by Dr. Timothy Lethbridge.
              </p>

              <p>
                My primary responsibilities working on Umple were the maintenance and improvement of <a href="http://try.umple.org">UmpleOnline</a>, the web-based demo and teaching tool for Umple. I worked with many different technologies over the summer. Early on, my work focused on javascript, CSS, and HTML as I squashed bugs and refactored sections of UmpleOnline. Certain bugs led me into the backend of UmpleOnline &mdash; which is in PHP &mdash; and the core of Umple &mdash; which is written in Umple that generates Java.  
              </p>

              <p>
                Later in the summer, I focused on making UmpleOnline easier to change: the large majority of the code associated with UmpleOnline were not backed by tests. I used a headless browser called <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> along with ruby libaries <a href="https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist">Poltergeist</a> (Ruby bindings for PhantomJS), <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> (Ruby library for user-centric website automation), and <a href="http://rspec.info/">rspec</a> (Ruby testing framework). This was the most educational and most fun part of my summer.
              </p>

              <h3>Engineer/DIY Hacker</h3>
              <p>
                From May 2013 to April 2014, I worked in <a href="http://www.pellinglab.net/">the Pelling Lab</a> for Dr. Andrew Pelling &mdash; a professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Ottawa. For this year, I was working on implementing a project that would allow people in the DIY biology community interact with Dr. Pelling's lab via Twitter. The idea for the project morphed from a biological sample monitor to a multi-sample, DIY microscope built from repurposed webcams. In this project, I was responsible for the design and implementation of both the software and the hardware. 
              </p>

              <p>
                The large majority of the software was written in Python, with some hardware-facing components written in Arduino (a domain specific language based on C). The software was responsible for recieving requests from Twitter, parsing and interpreting these requests, then interfacing with the hardware &mdash; motors, cameras, and sensors. The Twitter user would then have an image of the requested biological sample tweeted back at them.
              </p>

              <p>
                I designed the hardware and built it using modular 3d-printed pieces. The overall design went through several iterations:

                Hardware design was a very different experience. I made plenty of mistakes and learned a lot about managing projects to meet deadlines. The middle device was displayed as part of <a href="http://www.toxicitywinnipeg.com/">Toxicity</a>, a bioart exhibit in Winnipeg, and was <a href="https://twitter.com/SciTechCurator/status/481482471582621696/photo/1">recently donated</a> to the Canada Science and Technology Museum as part of their microscope collection.
