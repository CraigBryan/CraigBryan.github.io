          My name is Craig Bryan, and I'm currently studying software engineering at the University of Ottawa. I recently saw TripAdvisor's booth at the High Tech Career fair at uOttawa. After hearing about the positions you have available, I began to think how awesome it would be to work at TripAdvisor &mdash; it is a globally recognizable brand that I have seen all over the world, and that I have personally used many times. It is an exciting prospect to work on a product that I have an interest in as a user.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the career fair, I learned that you are looking for developers with skills in Java and the standard front-end web tools (HTML, CSS, and Javascript). I believe these technologies to be some of my strongest technical skills. Java, in addition to being the very first language I taught myself, is uOttawa's primary teaching language. I've had more exposure and practice with Java than any other language. I have worked and hacked on many web-based projects, so I've used those front-end tools extensively. My most recent work (other than this website) has been on <a href="http://cruise.eecs.uottawa.ca/umpleonline/">UmpleOnline</a> &mdash; a website that runs <em>tons</em> of Javascript.
        </p>

        <p>
          In lieu of a standard paper CV, I've opted to share with you my new online resume. Most job applications are now done remotely via the internet and leave the applicant with almost no opportunity to showcase their personality. This website is my attempt to make my application more personal, and, at the same time, show you some of my work. You can see all the source for this website <a href="https://github.com/CraigBryan/CraigBryan.github.io">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I would absolutely love the chance to talk further about working at TripAdvisor with you. Please, <a href="index.html">click here</a> or use the menu to the left to see the rest of my resume.

        <p>
          Sincerely, <br> Craig Bryan.
